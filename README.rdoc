# Confer

Confer helps conect a conference attendee to one other person who is attending the same conference. Connections are made via voice, SMS, and chat.

# Installing

Confer needs a twilio account in order to work. It expects to see `account_sid`, `auth_token` and `twilio_number` in your `secrets.yml` file.

Additionally, it needs to be exposed to the internet in order to accept incoming calls. If you're running on a local machine, the very excellent [ngrok.com] could help with this.
